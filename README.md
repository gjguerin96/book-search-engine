# book-search-engine

## Description

This application allows the user to search for books in the Google Books API, and save the ones they are interested in. It is useful for any avid reader looking for more books to read in the future. I built it to learn more about GraphQL and Apollo, as well as the full MERN Stack. I also learned how to use MongoDB atlas to deploy an application with Heroku.

## Usage
See screenshot below. Use the button in the upper right corner to create an account, and then use the search bar to find books. When you are logged in you can save books to your collection, which you can view with the See Your Books button.

## Credits
This application uses the Google Books API. It requires graphQL to run, and was deployed using heroku. I recieved some assistance from my tutor, Vinnie Lopez.
